//Formatting instructions:
//each object should be continuous, with a blank line at the end
//the first line of each object should be 
//	"[class name]: [optional value]"
//all following lines should be 
//	"[parameter name] = [value]"
//there should be no extra lines within an object's continous section
//any extra lines outside of the objects are ignored
